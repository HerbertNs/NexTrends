*Still in development.*

You will need your own datasheets with the youtube links inside or you can compile some from the **youtube_scraper.py** . Make sure you have a google api key.

After downloading the thumbnails you can use the **image_grading.py** in **sentimental_analysis** to grade the images. 

Then you can test an image using the standards obtained from image grading. It will be updated when more images are downloaded and data is compiled for it.
